# Python
Share GIS Python Scripts here!

This repository was created to serve as a central hub for Nebraska GIS professionals to share Python scripts they've written.
Don't worry, though. You don't have to submit ANYTHING. If you're here just to download some scripts, that's OKAY.
Try them out for yourself! 

If you come up with anything cool or useful, please do share it back with us.

For questions, email us at gitNebraska@gmail.com.

Happy Scripting!
